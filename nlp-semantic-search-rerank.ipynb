However, the major population centres of Toronto and Montreal, as well as the former capital of Lower Canada, Quebec City, all had legislators dissatisfied with Kingston. Anglophone merchants in Quebec were the main group supportive of the Kingston arrangement. In 1842, a vote rejected Kingston as the capital, and study of potential candidates included the then-named Bytown, but that option proved less popular than Toronto or Montreal. In 1843, a report of the Executive Council recommended Montreal as the capital as a more fortifiable location and commercial centre, however, the Governor General refused to execute a move without a parliamentary vote. In 1844, the Queen's acceptance of a parliamentary vote moved the capital to Montreal.\n\n\n\ntitle:Ottawa\n\n\n\nurl:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22219\n\n\n\nviews:2000\n\n\n\n\n\nitem 1\n\n_additional:{'distance': -150.28354}\n\n\n\nlang:en\n\n\n\ntext:For brief periods, Toronto was twice the capital of the united Province of Canada: first from 1849 to 1852, following unrest in Montreal, and later 1856–1858.

Since at least the 1930s, supporters of the Crown have held the opinion that the Canadian monarch is also one of the rare unified elements of Canadian society, focusing both \"the historic consciousness of the nation\" and various forms of patriotism and national love \"[on] the point around which coheres the nation's sense of a continuing personality\". Former Governor General Vincent Massey articulated in 1967 that the monarchy \"is part of ourselves. It is linked in a very special way with our national life. It stands for qualities and institutions which mean Canada to every one of us and which for all our differences and all our variety have kept Canada Canadian.\" But, according to Arthur Bousfield and Gary Toffoli, Canadians were, through the late 1960s to the 2000s, encouraged by the federal government to \"neglect, ignore, forget, reject, debase, suppress, even hate, and certainly treat as foreign what their parents and grandparents, whether spiritual or blood, regarded as the basis of Canadian nationhood, autonomy, and history\", including the monarchy. Former Governor General Roland Michener said in 1970 that anti-monarchists claimed the Canadian Crown is foreign and incompatible with Canada's multicultural society, which the government promoted as a Canadian identifier, and Lawrence Martin called in 2007 for Canada to become a republic in order to \"re-brand the nation\". However, Michener also stated, \"[the monarchy] is our own by inheritance and choice, and contributes much to our distinctive Canadian identity and our chances of independent survival amongst the republics of North and South America.\" Journalist Christina Blizzard emphasized in 2009 that the monarchy \"made [Canada] a haven of peace and justice for immigrants from around the world\", while Michael Valpy contended in 2009 that the Crown's nature permitted non-conformity amongst its subjects, thereby opening the door to multiculturalism and pluralism.\n\ni:1\n\nEarly modern period\n\nNorth America outside the zone of Spanish settlement was a contested area in the 17th century. Spain had founded small settlements in Florida and Georgia but nowhere near the size of those in New Spain or the Caribbean islands. France, The Netherlands, and Great Britain held several colonies in North America and the West Indies from the 17th century, 100 years after the Spanish and Portuguese established permanent colonies. The British colonies in North America were founded between 1607 (Virginia) and 1733 (Georgia). The Dutch explored the east coast of North America and began founding settlements in what they called New Netherland (now New York State.). France colonized what is now Eastern Canada, founding Quebec City in 1608. France's loss in the Seven Years' War resulted in the transfer of New France to Great Britain. The Thirteen Colonies, in lower British North America, rebelled against British rule in 1775, largely due to the taxation that Great Britain was imposing on the colonies. The British colonies in Canada remained loyal to the crown, and a provisional government formed by the Thirteen Colonies proclaimed their independence on July 4, 1776 and subsequently became the original 13 United States of America. With the 1783 Treaty of Paris ending the American Revolutionary War, Britain recognised the former Thirteen Colonies' independence.\n\ni:2\n\nFlag of Canada\n\nBy the Second World War, the Red Ensign was viewed as Canada's \"de facto\" national flag. A joint committee of the Senate and House of Commons was appointed on November 8, 1945, to recommend a national flag to officially adopt. It received 2,409 designs from the public and was addressed by the director of the Historical Section of the Canadian Army, Fortescue Duguid, who pointed out that red and white were Canada's official colours and there was already an emblem representing the country: three joined maple leaves seen on the escutcheon of the Canadian coat of arms. By May 9 the following year, the committee reported back with a recommendation \"that the national flag of Canada should be the Canadian red ensign with a maple leaf in autumn golden colours in a bordered background of white\". The Legislative Assembly of Quebec had urged the committee to not include any of what it deemed as \"foreign symbols\", including the Union Flag, and Mackenzie King, then still prime minister, declined to act on the report; fearing it may lead to political instability. As a result, the Union Flag was kept as a national flag, and the order to fly the Canadian Red Ensign at government buildings was maintained.\n"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"query_1 = \"What is the capital of Canada?\"\nresults = keyword_search(query_1,\n                         client,\n                         properties=[\"text\", \"title\", \"url\", \"views\", \"lang\", \"_additional {distance}\"],\n                         num_results=500\n                        )\n\nfor i, result in enumerate(results):\n    print(f\"i:{i}\")\n    print(result.get('title'))\n    #print(result.get('text'))","metadata":{"height":200},"execution_count":20,"outputs":[{"ename":"UnexpectedStatusCodeException","evalue":"Query was not successful!

Spain had founded small settlements in Florida and Georgia but nowhere near the size of those in New Spain or the Caribbean islands. France, The Netherlands, and Great Britain held several colonies in North America and the West Indies from the 17th century, 100 years after the Spanish and Portuguese established permanent colonies. The British colonies in North America were founded between 1607 (Virginia) and 1733 (Georgia). The Dutch explored the east coast of North America and began founding settlements in what they called New Netherland (now New York State.). France colonized what is now Eastern Canada, founding Quebec City in 1608. France's loss in the Seven Years' War resulted in the transfer of New France to Great Britain. The Thirteen Colonies, in lower British North America, rebelled against British rule in 1775, largely due to the taxation that Great Britain was imposing on the colonies. The British colonies in Canada remained loyal to the crown, and a provisional government formed by the Thirteen Colonies proclaimed their independence on July 4, 1776 and subsequently became the original 13 United States of America. With the 1783 Treaty of Paris ending the American Revolutionary War, Britain recognised the former Thirteen Colonies' independence., index: 1, relevance_score: 0.12797922>\n\n\n\ni:1\n\nRerankResult<document['text']: In his 1990 book, \"Continental Divide: the Values and Institutions of the United States and Canada,\" Seymour Martin Lipset argues that the presence of the monarchy in Canada helps distinguish Canadian identity from American identity. Since at least the 1930s, supporters of the Crown have held the opinion that the Canadian monarch is also one of the rare unified elements of Canadian society, focusing both \"the historic consciousness of the nation\" and various forms of patriotism and national love \"[on] the point around which coheres the nation's sense of a continuing personality\". Former Governor General Vincent Massey articulated in 1967 that the monarchy \"is part of ourselves. It is linked in a very special way with our national life. It stands for qualities and institutions which mean Canada to every one of us and which for all our differences and all our variety have kept Canada Canadian.\" But, according to Arthur Bousfield and Gary Toffoli, Canadians were, through the late 1960s to the 2000s, encouraged by the federal government to \"neglect, ignore, forget, reject, debase, suppress, even hate, and certainly treat as foreign what their parents and grandparents, whether spiritual or blood, regarded as the basis of Canadian nationhood, autonomy, and history\", including the monarchy. Former Governor General Roland Michener said in 1970 that anti-monarchists claimed the Canadian Crown is foreign and incompatible with Canada's multicultural society, which the government promoted as a Canadian identifier, and Lawrence Martin called in 2007 for Canada to become a republic in order to \"re-brand the nation\". However, Michener also stated, \"[the monarchy] is our own by inheritance and choice, and contributes much to our distinctive Canadian identity and our chances of independent survival amongst the republics of North and South America.\" Journalist Christina Blizzard emphasized in 2009 that the monarchy \"made [Canada] a haven of peace and justice for immigrants from around the world\", while Michael Valpy contended in 2009 that the Crown's nature permitted non-conformity amongst its subjects, thereby opening the door to multiculturalism and pluralism., index: 0, relevance_score: 0.03073393>\n\n\n\ni:2\n\nRerankResult<document['text']: By the Second World War, the Red Ensign was viewed as Canada's \"de facto\" national flag. A joint committee of the Senate and House of Commons was appointed on November 8, 1945, to recommend a national flag to officially adopt. It received 2,409 designs from the public and was addressed by the director of the Historical Section of the Canadian Army, Fortescue Duguid, who pointed out that red and white were Canada's official colours and there was already an emblem representing the country: three joined maple leaves seen on the escutcheon of the Canadian coat of arms. By May 9 the following year, the committee reported back with a recommendation \"that the national flag of Canada should be the Canadian red ensign with a maple leaf in autumn golden colours in a bordered background of white\". The Legislative Assembly of Quebec had urged the committee to not include any of what it deemed as \"foreign symbols\", including the Union Flag, and Mackenzie King, then still prime minister, declined to act on the report; fearing it may lead to political instability. As a result, the Union Flag was kept as a national flag, and the order to fly the Canadian Red Ensign at government buildings was maintained., index: 2, relevance_score: 0.015424552>\n\n\n"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Improving Dense Retrieval with ReRank","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from utils import dense_retrieval","metadata":{"height":30},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"query_2 = \"Who is the tallest person in history?\"","metadata":{"height":30},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"results = dense_retrieval(query_2,client)","metadata":{"height":30},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"for i, result in enumerate(results):\n    print(f\"i:{i}\")\n    print(result.get('title'))\n    print(result.get('text'))\n    print()","metadata":{"height":98},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"texts = [result.get('text') for result in results]\nreranked_text = rerank_responses(query_2, texts)","metadata":{"height":47},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"for i, rerank_result in enumerate(reranked_text):\n    print(f\"i:{i}\")\n    print(f\"{rerank_result}\")\n    print()","metadata":{"height":81},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{"height":30},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{"height":30},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{"height":30},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{"height":30},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{"height":30},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{"height":30},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{"height":30},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{"height":30},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{"height":30},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{"height":30},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{"height":30},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{"height":30},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{"height":30},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{"height":30},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{"height":30},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{"height":30},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{"height":30},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{"height":30},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{"height":30},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
